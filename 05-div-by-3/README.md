# Div By 3
#### Respond to the following:

1. A number is considered *prime* if its only factors are 1 and itself. For example, 7 is prime (1 and 7 are the only factors) and 9 is not (1, 3 and 9 are factors).  
Outline an algorithm to determine whether or not a number is prime.  
Think of the following method header:
`public static boolean isPrime(int num)`

  * create a list to hold the factors. and divide the number by a variable s. in a for loop increase s by one and if s >= 100 the loop stops and if the factor list holds only 2 numbers that it's a prime number else its not prime.
