# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * Take severything from the string starting at index a all the way to the end of the string.

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * Takes part of the string, starting from index a and up to but not including index b.

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * Returns -1 if str is not inside the string or if str is within the string it'll return the index value where you can find str.

  * `.equals(str)`
    * Compares two strings to see if they are identical.


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * The for loop repeats while i is less then the length of string s.
